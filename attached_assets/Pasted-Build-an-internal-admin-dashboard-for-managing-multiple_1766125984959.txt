Build an internal admin dashboard for managing multiple businesses that use an embeddable AI voice widget.

Important

This dashboard is for internal use only

Businesses do NOT log in

Businesses only receive a widget <script>

The dashboard controls all configuration

Tech stack

Frontend only

HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript

Firebase Firestore as the database

Firebase Web SDK (Firestore only)

No backend logic in Replit

Firestore structure (must follow exactly)
businesses/{businessId}


Example document:

{
  "businessName": "ABC Restaurant",
  "status": "active",
  "context": {
    "description": "ABC Restaurant is a casual family restaurant serving Pakistani and Indian food.",
    "services": ["Dine-in", "Takeaway", "Delivery"],
    "hours": "Daily 11 AM to 11 PM",
    "rules": [
      "Always greet warmly",
      "Ask dine-in or takeaway",
      "Do not guess prices"
    ]
  },
  "widget": {
    "logoUrl": "https://...",
    "theme": {
      "primaryColor": "#0ea5e9",
      "mode": "dark"
    }
  },
  "createdAt": timestamp,
  "updatedAt": timestamp
}

UX / Design

Clean, professional admin-style UI

Sidebar navigation:

Add Business

Forms should be simple and readable

No animations required

Constraints

No authentication logic required (assume trusted internal use)

No analytics

No billing

No role management

No external UI libraries

Goal

Create a simple internal dashboard that allows centralized management of business context and widget appearance, where all logic is enforced server-side by Firebase Functions and Gemini.
